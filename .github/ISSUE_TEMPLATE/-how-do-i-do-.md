This library does not offer support in the style of "how do I do XYZ?"

This is due to the fact that the best place to ask questions of JsJoda is the [JsJoda documentation](https://js-joda.github.io/). This library is meant to provide near identical function signatures of JsJoda.

So before asking a question here, please ask it on StackOverflow instead or look in the JsJoda documentation.

If however you feel that the documentation is unclear, you can ask the question below. But if I can find a link to the explanation in the JsJoda documentation I will be very sad.
